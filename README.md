# Minimake

A simplified version of the Unix `make` tool developed at EPITA as part of the Systems Programming curriculum.

## Overview
Minimake parses Makefiles and executes build rules with dependency resolution, variable expansion, and command execution.

## Features
- Makefile parsing (variables, rules, dependencies)
- Variable expansion (`$(VAR)` and `${VAR}`)
- Recursive dependency execution
- Command logging and execution via `/bin/sh`
- Command line options (`-f`, `-p`, `-h`)
- Error handling with proper exit codes

## Technologies
- C (low-level programming)
- POSIX system calls (`fork`, `execl`, `waitpid`)
- File I/O

## Build
make

## Usage
./minimake [OPTIONS] [TARGETS]
    "-h"            display help
    "-p"            print rules and variables
    "-f" filename   specify Makefile (default: Makefile)

## Context
Completed as part of the EPITA curriculum, emphasizing practical implementation of systems programming concepts.
